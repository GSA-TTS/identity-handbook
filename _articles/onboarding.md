## TTS Onboarding

TTS Talent has [their own onboarding checklist in Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w0WSTUT0l7q19mAI6c2QCIpCFs0Cei4eukaiiRBTbRA/edit#gid=1775743049) that they share with new employees. The Login.gov tab on that document has one item, a link to this page in our handbook.

## Login.gov team onboarding documents

Each Login.gov team has their own personalized [GDoc/Onboarding Template / Checklist](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zq00M0H4QzXTLvFK3IMN-vhMcsKkx0f3?usp=sharing), you'll get one of these documents when you start at Login.gov.

The following onboarding tasks are applicable to all employees.

  - Make sure your account is set up [like this](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/slack/).
  - Make sure to join `#login`, the main announcement channel for our team
  - Contractors with full Slack access should add the word "contractor" to their Slack profile for the benefit of the wider TTS audience.

    - Under "My calendars" list, click "Other Calendars +"
    - Select "From URL"
    - Then paste in `gsa.gov_6ovul6pcsmgd40o8pqn7qmge5g@group.calendar.google.com`. 
- Add yourself to the [`team.yml`](https://github.com/18F/identity-private/blob/main/team/team.yml) file
- Request access to relevant Google Groups, [the handbook has a list of active groups](https://login-handbook.app.cloud.gov/articles/email.html#internal-team-lists)

- (Optional) [Add your gpg key to github](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account/)

## For the on-boarding buddy to complete

As an on-boarding buddy you'll be a new employee's main point of contact and Login.gov guide for a couple weeks.
Look at this work as a power multiplier, you are helping someone gain a firm foundation to work upon, you are starting up a new engine.

  - *For members NOT needing **push** access*: Also add to the [identity-team-yml](https://github.com/orgs/18F/teams/identity-team-yml/members) team, which grants read-only access. (contact [team maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/18F/teams/identity-team-yml/members?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=+role%3Amaintainer) for this)
- [Create a new issue in the `identity-devops` Github repository using the onboarding template](https://github.com/18F/identity-devops/issues/new?labels=administration&template=onboarding-devops.md&title=Onboarding+for+%5Binsert+new+team+member%27s+name%5D) and ping `@login-devops-oncall` in Slack to alert them to the new onboarding issue.
- Schedule a daily pairing session in GCal for an hour or two. Use the time to walk through project details, cooperate on environment setup, work on a ticket, etc. Taper off in a way that makes sense to you and your buddy.
- Give intro to weekly ceremonies and team workflow
- [Request Slack access with ServiceNow](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp?id=sc_category&sys_id=f9874e76db5003400dc9ff621f96190d&catalog_id=e0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4)

- Approve their PR to update [`team.yml`](https://github.com/18F/identity-private/blob/main/team/team.yml) with their info
- Verify their membership in all appropriate Google Groups. This will grant them permission to see the Login.gov Team Drive and other Google Docs
  - Add everyone to `login-all@`

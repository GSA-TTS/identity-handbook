## TTS Onboarding

TTS Talent has [their own onboarding checklist in Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w0WSTUT0l7q19mAI6c2QCIpCFs0Cei4eukaiiRBTbRA/edit#gid=1775743049) that they share with new employees. The Login.gov tab on that document has one item, a link to this page in our handbook.

## Login.gov team onboarding documents

Each Login.gov team has their own personalized [GDoc/Onboarding Template / Checklist](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zq00M0H4QzXTLvFK3IMN-vhMcsKkx0f3?usp=sharing), you'll get one of these documents when you start at Login.gov.

- Make sure your GitHub account is set up [like this](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/github/#setup).

    - Click "Add" when prompted to add the calendar

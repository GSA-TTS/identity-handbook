## Our principles

- **Change the culture.** Don’t just build a product — disrupt bureaucracies and challenge assumptions.
- **Be responsive.** Solve for actual needs and problems, not perceived ones.
- **Serve the people first, and the government second.** We’re here to serve the American public as a whole (and even foreign visitors), so they should always be our primary focus. We can also strive to make it easier for agencies to fulfill that mission.
- **Create simplicity.** Reduce cognitive burden. Absorb the complexity on behalf of the public to give them a delightful experience.
- **Be smart.** Informed decisions over superfluous options.
- **Be personalized.** Reach people where they are with contextually relevant experiences.
- **Be empathetic.** Go beyond intuitive functional designs to deliver an aesthetically beautiful experience. Design for the ideal, not the lowest common denominator. Create loyal and passionate users, not passive ones.
- **Be an open platform.** Build for the future. Be lean, modular, and decentralized. Expose APIs. Encourage reuse and collaboration through interoperability. Eat our own dog food.
- **Embrace unpredictability.** Evolve with the experiment. Respond and pivot as needed.
- **Share.** Keep the public informed, and actively seek out feedback.
- **Measure impact**: Identify the metrics that represent outcomes for users. Measure and be accountable to those.


## Our creative process

- **Treat every interaction as an opportunity to delight.** From pixels to copy, code to community, each part of the process should be a positive experience to engage and defy expectations.
- **Always ask:** Are we solving for the right solution for the public?
- **Mobile first.** Bake responsive web design into the DNA - it’s not an afterthought, but core to the experience.
- **Be lean and agile:** Use prototypes and experiments to validate learning and make data-informed decisions. Ship unfinished code and be prepared to fail fast.
- **Embrace ignorance.** Run with our naiveté on government constraints as well as the public’s lack of familiarity with the bureaucracy.
- **Don’t unnecessarily handicap the creative process.** Say “Yes, and” instead of “no, but.”
- **Meaningful deadlines are not arbitrary.** Milestones should have a purpose.
- **No HIPPOs** (highest paid person’s opinion). Titles and hierarchy don’t impact weight of ideas.
- **Meetings are the exception, not the rule.** Have a clear understanding of who the meeting is with, who they are, the purpose of the meeting, and the intended outcomes.

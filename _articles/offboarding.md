## Full Offboarding

If a person leaves the Login.gov program they should have privileges revoked.

### For offboarding employee to complete

Review the [Leaving TTS page in the TTS Handbook](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/leaving-tts/#when-its-time-to-leave-tts) and follow the instructions there.

  - `Create Bulk Sub Tasks` on the new issue and use the `Login.gov Offboarding Assistant Tasks` template.
- If this person is leaving GSA/TTS, review and share [leaving GSA/TTS guidance](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/leaving-tts/).

## Login.gov staffing change process

Follow these steps to re-staff a Login.gov employee internally.

1. Reassignment is requested by Login.gov staff, product owner and/or supervisor with the following information:
    1. Employee being considered for reassignment
    1. Why the rquest is being made
    1. Employee's current team
    1. Employee's proposed team
1. Create a [Leads Trello Card](https://trello.com/b/C3fvwWz0/login-leadership-master) for the staffing change to hold notes including feedback summaries, effective dates, etc.
1. Gather feedback about the change
    1. A Login.gov Supervisor and/or Lead has a conversation with the staff member that is potentially changing teams to get a better understanding of their perspective.
    1. On both teams, a Login.gov Supervisor and/or Lead discusses with the assigned Product Owner and Scrum Master for those teams on plans for this change.
    1. On both teams, the Scrum Master informs the team, ex: during stand-up. 
1. This staffing change is included as a topic in weekly staffing meetings. Once all required conversations have occurred and there is no blocking feedback, the employee switches teams. If there is blocking feedback, the employee does not switch teams.
1. The staffing decision is documented as completed in the assigned Trello card and it moves to Done.

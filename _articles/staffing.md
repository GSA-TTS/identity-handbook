## Login.gov staffing change process

Follow these steps to re-staff a Login.gov employee internally.

1. Reassignment is requested by a Login.gov employee or supervisor.
1. Create a [Leads Trello Card](https://trello.com/b/C3fvwWz0/login-leadership-master) for the staffing change to hold notes including feedback summaries, effective dates, etc.
1. Gather feedback about the change
    1. A supervisor or lead has a conversation with the human that is potentially changing teams to get their feedback.
    1. On both teams, a supervisor or lead discusses with the Scrum Master and gets feedback.
    1. On both teams, the Scrum Master informs the team, ex: during stand-up. 
1. This staffing change is included as a topic in weekly staffing meetings. Once all required conversations have occurred and there is no blocking feedback, the employee switches teams. If there is blocking feedback, the employee does not switch teams.
1. A decision is documented in the Trello card and it moves to Done.

### Be Bold

In the spirit of the Wikipedia, **[be bold][be-bold]**! Editing and contributing
many small changes helps us keep things up to date!

### Sensitive Information

Do *not* add any information to the handbook if it contains:

- Architectural information (like diagrams)
- AWS Account IDs
- AWS Bucket IDs
- Internal networking names
- Personal IP addresses or partner IP addresses
- Personal phone numbers or email addresses
- Google Group email addresses

It's OK to include SSH instructions in runbooks, because those don't necessarily
disclose sensitive details of our systems.

### Alternatives

If you want to include sensitive information in a relevant handbook article,
put it in a private Google Doc and link to that doc the handbook.

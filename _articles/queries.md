## Query timeout

For queries that take longer than the default timeout (2.5s), run the following command to extend the timeout.

**Note:** Please double check that you're on a read replica before running potentially expensive queries.

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute 'SET statement_timeout = 200000'
```

## Fully Registered Users

Returns the number of fully registered users.

**Note**: This table has been backfilled as far back as 2017, so it is good for all time.

```ruby
RegistrationLog.where.not(registered_at: nil).count
```

## IAL2 Users

Returns the number of users with IAL2 credentials.

```ruby
Profile.where(active: true).count
```

## Overview

This is a quick reference for how to handle support requests from partner. These
can include questions on Slack, emails to `partners@`, or action items
from meetings with partners.

For the purposes of this article, we define a **partner support ticket** as _a
request from a partner that requires action from the Partnerships Engineering
team_. This can also be thought of as the "toil" required to support our
partners. We include in this definition any updates to the YAML files in the
[18F/identity-idp-config](https://github.com/18F/identity-idp-config) repo as
maintaining accurate records for our agreements and other partner data is
critical in supporting our partners.

## Ticket tracking

We currently track all of our partner support tickets in
[ZenDesk](https://logingov.zendesk.com/agent/dashboard).
This allows us to maintain a single view of all of the support activities being
handled by the Partnerships Engineering team as well as evaluate our workload
and throughput. For more information on how the sheet is structured see the
[Cheat
Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kQs7sShRNRWcoH0O-AaMYdyDiuNcLUEc7PgKRnLiSRM/edit#).

## Entering tickets

In an ideal world, all partner support requests would automatically create a
ticket in Smartsheet so they can easily be tracked. To that end, the Smartsheet
does include several different forms for partners to submit requests directly to
us. However, at this time we also have several other channels through which
partners can communicate with us:

* HubSpot (`partners@`)
* Direct email
* Slack (e.g. `#login-partner-support`)
* Tech Syncs / meetings

If you see or are made aware of a request from a partner that **does not**
originate from a Smartsheet form, please create a corresponding ticket in
Smartsheet using the [Internal ticket entry
form](https://app.smartsheetgov.com/b/form/d6cbe43520d14112a6ce1aa9c4c8aaef).
Make sure to include as much information as possible, and if the request
originates through a channel that can be linked to (e.g. HubSpot or Slack)
make sure to include a link to the thread in the "Comms URL" field.

## Working on tickets

As you're working on tickets, please make use of Smartsheet's commenting feature
to leave updates as to your progress (as needed). For simple requests (e.g.
questions that can be answered directly) this is not required but for longer
lived tickets (e.g. a new integration launch) it is helpful to have a history
for the request.

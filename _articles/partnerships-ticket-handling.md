## Overview

This is a quick reference for how to handle support requests from partner. These
can include questions on Slack, emails to `partners@`, or action items
from meetings with partners.

For the purposes of this article, we define a **partner support ticket** as _a
request from a partner that requires action from the Partnerships Engineering
team_. We include in this definition any updates to the YAML files in the
[18F/identity-idp-config](https://github.com/18F/identity-idp-config) repo as
maintaining accurate records for our agreements and other partner data is
critical in supporting our partners.

## Ticket tracking

We currently track all of our partner support tickets in
[ZenDesk](https://logingov.zendesk.com/agent/dashboard).
This allows us to maintain a single view of all of the support activities being
handled by the Partnerships Engineering team as well as evaluate our workload
and throughput. For more information on the process of tracking tickets see the
[Cheat
Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kQs7sShRNRWcoH0O-AaMYdyDiuNcLUEc7PgKRnLiSRM/edit#).

## Entering tickets

We strongly encourage partners to submit tickets through ZenDesk as to limit
the avenues of where the tickets are coming from. If there is missing information or
tickets that have not been created, below are some Slack channels that would be helpful:

* `#login-iaa`
* `#login-team-kimberly`
* `#login-partner-support`

If you see or are made aware of a request from a partner that **does not**
originate from ZenDesk, please create a corresponding ticket in
ZenDesk. Make sure to include as much information as possible, and if the request
originates through a channel that can be linked to (e.g. Slack)
make sure to include a link to the thread in the "Public Reply" field.

## Working on tickets

As you're working on tickets, please make use of ZenDesk's "Internal Note" feature to leave
updates as to your progress (as needed). For simple requests (e.g.
questions that can be answered directly) this is not required but for longer
lived tickets (e.g. a new integration launch) it is helpful to have a history
for the request. The "Interal Note" section is also a great place to put a link to the Github Pull Request, as
this helps anyone else viewing the ticket what progress has been made.

This article describes a few simple tips and tricks for creating a product demo with a mobile device.

## Setup

* On an iPhone or other iOS device, you may need to change your settings to enable screen recordings. Apple provides [instructions on how to do so in their knowledge base](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935).
* You may want to create an Apple Note to act as a "title slide." This might be a good way to introduce the demo, and provide future viewers with context about what they're about to see.
* You may want to use a non-production environment such as [dev](https://idp.dev.identitysandbox.gov/) (or possibly the [OIDC dev sample app](https://dev-identity-oidc-sinatra.app.cloud.gov/)); especially if your recording would involve identity information (PII).
* For identity-related demos, you may want to have a user authenticated and ready-to-go before you start recording. (eg. Don't start by creating an account unless that's what your demo is meant to showcase.)

#### Other tips

* As a demo recording, viewers may not be as familiar with Login.gov or the product features you're trying to showcase. It's helpful to set context, whenever possible.
* When creating a screen recording, you should describe what actions you're taking (eg. "I'm going to scroll" or "I'm going to tap 'Continue' now") so the audience can understand what is happening.
* You can upload your recording from your iOS device to Google Drive. From there, you can embed it in a presentation or download it on your Mac workstation to use elsewhere.

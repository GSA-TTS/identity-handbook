## What is a roll plan?

A roll plan documents changes to production. Key pieces of a roll plan:

- Include step-by-step instructions
- Include "rollback" instructions to undo changes in case things go poorly
- Is peer-reviewed

## Good candidates for roll plan documentation

- Complicated or coordinated feature flag enabling or configuration changes

  How Login.gov is funded and what it means

Login.gov, like a number of other programs in TTS, does not receive annual
appropriations from Congress and must therefore be cost-recoverable. This means
that the program must eventually cover its operating expenses through the money
it charges the partner agencies that leverage its services. Login.gov was
created in 2017 and is still on the path to full cost-recovery, currently
expected by 2024.

Cost-recoverability has a number of consequences for Login.gov. First, it means
that it is not our mission to make money, so any cost-savings we achieve will
ultimately result in lower costs for our partners. It also means that in general
we are incentivized to operate as efficiently as possible to ensure we can
achieve and sustain cost-recoverability.

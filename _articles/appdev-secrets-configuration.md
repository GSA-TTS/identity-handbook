## Overview

The IDP, Dashboard and PIVCAC apps download their `application.yml`
when we activate/deploy an instance (see [`deploy/activate`][deploy-activate]
and the [`activate.rb`][download-from-s3]). Since apps only download new values
during instance activation **a recycle is necessary before apps can use
updated configs**.


We store these `application.yml` files in S3, and each environment (`int`, `dev`)
has its own separate file, so secrets and configs need to be explicitly copied
across environments, they are not implicitly shared.

The S3 buckets that contain secrets are versioned, so we can recover old versions
if needed.

[download-from-s3]: https://github.com/18F/identity-idp/blob/a95fd33d24c6761818993cfbc334a28986783034/lib/deploy/activate.rb#L93-L97

At the end of the day, since these are just files in S3, you can use whatever workflow
you want to download, edit, and write them. Make sure you clean up files on your local
machine when done.

## Using `app-s3-secret`

The easiest way to edit secrets is the `app-s3-secret` command in the `identity-devops` repo.

These examples are for the IDP app in the `sandbox` AWS account and the `dev` environment:

### Viewing Secrets

```bash
cd identity-devops
aws-vault exec sandbox-power -- \
  ./bin/app-s3-secret --app idp --env dev
```

**Recommended**: `grep` for the keys you want to check

```bash
cd identity-devops
aws-vault exec sandbox-power -- \
  ./bin/app-s3-secret --app idp --env dev | grep foo
some_foo_key: 'true'
```

### Editing Secrets

The adding `--edit` will
- Download the secrets to a tempfile
- Open your `$EDITOR` (defaults to vim) to edit that copy
- Show you a diff of the preview before uploading
- Clean up the tempfile after

```bash
cd identity-devops
aws-vault exec sandbox-power -- \
  ./bin/app-s3-secret --app idp --env dev --edit
#
# opens vim
#
app-s3-secret: Here's a preview of your changes:
2a3
>   foobar: 'true'
app-s3-secret: Upload changes to S3? (y/n)
y
```

After updating, recycle the app so it creates new instances that will download
this updated config.

```bash
cd identity-devops
aws-vault exec sandbox-power -- \
  ./bin/asg-recycle dev idp
```

## Configuration in Rails Apps

To use a value in the `application.yml` in our Rails apps, follow these steps. The IDP, PKI,
and Dashboard apps all use this approach, with files named the same way.

1. Declare the feature flag in `lib/identity_config.rb`'s `#build_store` method.

    Example:
    ```ruby
config.add(:my_feature_flag, type: :boolean)
```

    View in
    [IDP repo](https://github.com/18F/identity-idp/blob/main/lib/identity_config.rb),
    [PKI repo](https://github.com/18F/identity-pki/blob/main/lib/identity_config.rb),
    [Dashboard repo](https://github.com/18F/identity-dashboard/blob/main/lib/identity_config.rb)

2. Configure a default value in `config/application.yml.default` at the top level of the file.
   **If there is no value specified in S3 for this config, this default value will be used in production**.

    Example:
    ```yml
my_feature_flag: 'true'
```

    View in
    [IDP repo](https://github.com/18F/identity-idp/blob/main/config/application.yml.default),
    [PKI repo](https://github.com/18F/identity-pki/blob/main/config/application.yml.default),
    [Dashboard repo](https://github.com/18F/identity-dashboard/blob/main/config/application.yml.default)

3. To use the value in code, access it via as a property of `IdentityConfig.store`

    Example:
    ```ruby
IdentityConfig.store.my_feature_flag
```

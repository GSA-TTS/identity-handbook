For contractors, Login.gov has a default 45 hour cap on hours worked per week.

### Overtime Requests

#### Federal Employees

There are resources on GSA InSite

- [GSA Time and Leave Policy](https://insite.gsa.gov/directives-library/time-and-leave-administration-policy-60101-hrm?term=)
- [Overtime Pay Fact Sheet](https://insite.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/OVERTIME%20PAY%20-%20FACT%20SHEET%20COVID19%20v2.pdf)
- [Covid leave and overtime FAQ](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/safety-and-security/covid19/covid19-telework/covid-leave-and-overtime?term=)

The [TTS Handbook has a page](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/overtime-and-comp-time/) that just redirects you to the TTS People Ops team.

#### Contractors

If a contractor feels they will be working over 45hour cap due to an incident, application launch or overloaded sprint, they should email the Login.gov FinOps lead, team Supervisor, and team Product Owner for approval prior to going over the weekly hour cap.
 
Notification exceptions: if an incident occurs on a Friday or weekend, email requests can be sent by EOD the following Monday.

## Login.gov Leave Guidance

Please follow [leave guidance in the TTS Handbook](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/travel-and-leave/leave/)

Additionally, please do the following

- Give at least one-sprint, but preferably two-sprint notice if you are going to be out for more than a couple days
- Put your OOO time in the Shared Login.gov Calendar and decline meetings
- List your back-ups in GMail auto-replies and Slack profile
  - If you don't know who your back-ups are, then you probably don't have any. If there's something you're responsible for and you'll be away for a while, consider talking to someone about being your back-up.
